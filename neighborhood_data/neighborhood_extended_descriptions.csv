The Town of Sharon looks like a typical New England town--its central Post Office Square marked by three tall white church spires, its tree-lined streets leafing green in summer and traced with delicate white lace in winter. Yet this picture postcard comes to life as a busy commuter town of professionals, academics, civil servants, and business people as well as local enterprises, restauranteurs, artists, and active participants in a network of civic organizations. 
Sharon, located 22 miles south of Boston, and almost midway between Boston and Providence, has access to Boston and Providence via MBTA commuter trains stopping at the Sharon station.  An Interfaith Clergy Council and an ""Affirming Diversity"" group foster cooperative understanding among several varieties of  Christian and Jewish congregations, an Islamic mosque, and a Unitarian church as well as adherents of Eastern religions, and the group sponsors an annual Martin Luther King Day Celebration.  The Sharon Public Schools system has twelve schools. Grades K-5 attend one of the three elementary schools: East, Cottage, and Heights. Grades 6-8 attend one of one middle school: Sharon Middle School, and grades 9-12 attend one high school: Sharon High School. The middle school and high school sports teams are known as the Eagles. The school system is noted for its outstanding academic performance and learning curriculum. In 2011, Sharon High School was awarded the National Blue Ribbon Schools award by the U.S. Department of Education.

Commuter rail service to North Station, Boston, is available from Hastings (travel time 30-31 minutes; no MBTA parking) and Kendal Green (travel time 28-29 minutes; 56 parking spaces - half designated as resident-only). Since 1969 Weston has participated in the Metco program, a voluntary busing program that brings minority students from Boston to suburban schools. Since 1999, Weston Windows, an integrated preschool, with classrooms at Woodland and Country Schools, has fulfilled the town’s mandate to educate children with special needs from the age of 3. The Elementary programs are designed to take advantage of the natural curiosity of children. The emphasis is on flexibility and individualization of instruction.
The Upper Elementary, grades 4 and 5, builds the academic and social independence of Middle School where students are still nurtured by the homeroom structure as students begin to have greater responsibilities for homework and extra-curricular activities.
The Middle School program is organized in a house system, with students in each house sharing the same set of subject matter teachers. This arrangement allows for a more personal and supervised education appropriate for young adolescents.
Weston High School offers its students a comprehensive and diversified program. SAT Scores at Weston High School are consistently among the top public schools in Massachusetts and College Placements are consistently near the top in Massachusetts in percentage of public school graduates entering four-year colleges.
