Newton has frequently been voted as one of the 10 best communities to live in. With a population of about 80,000 residents and approximately 26,000 homes, the City also houses Boston College, UMass Amherst at Mt. Ida Campus and Lasell College. The Boston Marathon runs right through the City with Heartbreak Hill beginning next to City Hall. The Newton Free Library is well respected as one of the largest, most well equipped libraries in the Commonwealth. By size the city is 18.3 square miles bordering the communities of Brookline, Brighton, Watertown, Waltham, Weston, Wellesley, Needham and West Roxbury. Newton also has east_west and north-south highway infrastructure with Routes 90 and 95 running through the city.",http://www.newtonma.gov/about/default.asp,,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton,_Massachusetts","https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Windermere_Rd,_Newton_MA.jpg",https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Newton_North_High_School_and_Tiger_Drive.agr.jpg,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lincoln_St,_Newton_Highlands_MA.jpg","https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bullough%27s_Pond,_Newton_MA.jpg"
1740,BOLTON,2,1,81,1017,977,1308,1688,2069,2381,2747,"People are attracted to Bolton today for the same reasons turn-of-the-century city dwellers saw the town as a rural retreat--its rural character, spectacular views and vistas, and the allure of its historic architecture. The town is still being shaped by many of the same factors that were present earlier in its history, however. Although Main Street is no longer a major thoroughfare for stagecoaches and cattle drives, the presence of I-495, and Route 117's continued function as a convenient route east toward Boston make Bolton a major attraction for commuters looking for a small town to settle in. If increased residential development threatens the very subject of that attraction through the loss of farmland, woods, and historic buildings, it is to be hoped that the knowledge and awareness made possible by the community-wide Historic Properties Survey, as well as the 1998 Preservation Plan, will help to counteract that threat.",https://www.townofbolton.com/discover-bolton/pages/late-modern-period-1945-present,,,"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Main_Street,_Bolton_MA.jpg","https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:First_Parish,_Bolton_MA.jpg","https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nashoba_Regional_High_School,_Bolton_MA.jpg",https://www.flickr.com/photos/masstravel/14929376524
